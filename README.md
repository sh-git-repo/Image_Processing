### Noise models

##### 1. Salt and Pepper noise :-
**(see noise package for more info)**
A simplistic model for salt and pepper noise where the image pixels are replaced by either 255 or 0, that is, 8bit representation of salt and respectively.


### Image filters

##### 1. Median filter :- 
**(see filters package for more info)**
A simplistic non linear filter where the image pixels are replaced by the value at the middle index of a sorted regular matrix, the shape of the matrix is (2n+1, 2n+1).
